Hey ! did you ever feel bad for not concentarting enough? , it's not you're mistake, there is a flaw in you're in your'e study method.\
ever heard of <b>Pomodoro Technique ?</b>

## what is Pomodoro technique?
- The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have‚Äîrather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.\

- The idea behind the technique is that the timer instills a sense of urgency. Rather than feeling like you have endless time in the workday to get things done and then ultimately squandering those precious work hours on distractions, you know you only have 25 minutes to make as much progress on a task as possible.
